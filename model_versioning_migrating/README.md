# Model Versioning and Migration Best Practices

## Introduction

Model versioning and tracking are essential for managing the lifecycle of machine learning models. This README provides guidelines for effectively controlling and migrating model versions, ensuring reproducibility, collaboration, and reliability.

## Azure OpenAI Model Version Upgrades

### How Azure Updates OpenAI Models

Azure releases new model versions in collaboration with OpenAI. Customers can test new versions upon release and are notified at least two weeks before a new version becomes the default. Previous major versions are maintained until their retirement date.

### Preparing for Version Upgrades

1. **Review What's New:**
   Stay updated with the latest changes and features in new model versions.
2. **Read Documentation:**
   Understand how to work with model versions by reading the documentation on [model deployments and version upgrades](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/model-versions).
3. **Test Applications:**
   Test your applications and workflows with new model versions.
4. **Update Code and Configuration:**
   Adapt your code and configurations to leverage new features and capabilities.

By following these best practices, you can effectively manage the lifecycle of your machine learning models, ensuring smooth transitions between versions and maintaining high standards of performance and reliability.

## Model Version Control & Tracking

### Key Components to Track

- **Use Case:** The specific application or problem the model is addressing.
- **Model Name:** The identifier for the model.
- **Provider:** The organization or platform providing the model.
- **Model Version:** The unique identifier for each version of the model.
- **Date:** When the model version was created or deployed.
- **Upgrades/Changes:** Notes on what has changed in this version.
- **Accuracy:** Performance metrics specific to the modelâ€™s task.
- **Inference Speed:** How quickly the model can make predictions.
- **Latency:** The time it takes to process a request and return a result.
- **Pricing:** The cost associated with using the model.

### Additional Categories to Consider

- **Use Case Specific Metrics:** Metrics relevant to the specific application (e.g., click-through rate for recommendation systems).
- **Cost of Prediction:** Computational cost of making a prediction.
- **Infrastructure Cost:** Costs for training, storing, and serving the models.
- **Maintenance Cost:** Costs for maintaining the models, including data storage and retraining.
- **Model Latency:** Time required for the model to make a prediction.
- **User Impact:** Impact on user experience, measured through feedback or engagement metrics.
- **Business Impact:** Metrics such as revenue increase, cost reduction, and customer satisfaction improvements.

## Benefits of Model Versioning

### Reproducibility

Ensures the same results can be obtained under the same conditions, enabling model application in different contexts and providing predictability.

### Collaboration

Facilitates tracking changes and makes the machine learning processes transparent for all team members, essential for scaling and managing multiple models.

### Reliability

Allows comparison of different model versions and reverting to a stable version if issues occur, mitigating the risk of unexpected results or breakdowns.

## Implementing Model Versioning

1. **Create Repositories and Branches:**
   Use distinct repositories and branches for each model and version.
2. **Use Version Control Tools:**
   Tools like [DVC](https://dvc.org/), [ML Metadata](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/mlmd), and [ModelDB](https://github.com/VertaAI/modeldb) can help manage model versions and track ML metadata.
3. **Automate with CI/CD Pipelines:**
   Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate versioning tasks and streamline deployment processes.
4. **Register Models:**
   Use tools like [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) to manage model stages (Staging, Production, Archived) and maintain a registry of model versions.

## Best Practices for Managing Model Version Upgrades

1. **Model Versioning:**
   Track and manage changes in ML models over time to maintain a complete history of changes.
2. **Data Versioning:**
   Track changes to the training datasets used for model creation.
3. **Code Versioning:**
   Ensure transparency and collaboration by tracking changes to the source code.
4. **Version Control System:**
   Utilize systems like Git for managing and tracking changes.
5. **Automated Pipelines:**
   Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the versioning process.
6. **Model Registry:**
   Register models and manage their stages with tools like MLflow.
7. **Reproducibility:**
   Store all versions of model components to ensure reproducibility.
8. **Collaboration:**
   Make ML processes transparent for all team members.
9. **Reliability:**
   Allow comparison of different model versions and revert to stable versions if errors occur.
