## Description of Various Evaluation Approaches

### LLM Evaluation Types

- **Classification Accuracy Evaluation:**
  - **Description:** Measures the performance of a classification system by comparing its outputs to ground truth.

- **QnA Groundedness Evaluation:**
  - **Description:** Computes the groundedness of the answer for the given question based on the context.

- **QnA Relevance Evaluation:**
  - **Description:** Computes the relevance of the answer for the given question based on the context.

- **QnA Coherence Evaluation:**
  - **Description:** Computes the coherence of the answer based on the question using a language model (LLM).

- **QnA Fluency Evaluation:**
  - **Description:** Computes the fluency of the answer based on the question using a language model (LLM).

- **QnA Ada Similarity Evaluation:**
  - **Description:** Computes the cosine similarity between the answer and the ground truth embedded with Ada embedding.

- **QnA GPT Similarity Evaluation:**
  - **Description:** Computes the similarity of the answer based on the question and ground truth using a language model (LLM).

- **QnA F1 Score Evaluation:**
  - **Description:** Computes the F1 Score based on words in the answer and ground truth.

### Example User Stories to Contextualize the LLM Evaluation Approaches

#### Classification Accuracy Evaluation

- **User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to measure the accuracy of my text classification model so that I can understand how often the model correctly classifies text into the correct categories.
- **Use Case:** After training a text classification model to categorize customer reviews into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments, the data scientist prepares a labeled test dataset containing customer reviews and their corresponding sentiments. They then use the Classification Accuracy Evaluation to compare the model's predicted categories against the actual categories in this prepared dataset to determine the overall accuracy of the model.

### QnA Groundedness Evaluation

- **User Story:** As an AI developer, I want to assess the groundedness of my QnA model's answers to ensure they are based on the given context, providing reliable and contextually accurate information.
- **Use Case:** The developer runs a QnA model that answers questions based on provided articles. They prepare a dataset containing questions, their corresponding context (articles), and the ground truth answers. The QnA Groundedness Evaluation is then used to check if the answers generated by the model are well-grounded in the provided context, ensuring that the responses are based on the given information.

### QnA Relevance Evaluation

- **User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to evaluate the relevance of my QnA model's answers to ensure they directly address the user's questions based on the context.
- **Use Case:** The researcher develops a QnA system for a medical advice chatbot. They prepare a dataset that includes medical questions, the context (medical documents or guidelines), and the relevant ground truth answers. The QnA Relevance Evaluation is then used to verify that the answers provided by the model are relevant to the specific questions asked, given the context.

### QnA Coherence Evaluation

- **User Story:** As a language model engineer, I want to measure the coherence of the answers generated by my QnA system to ensure they are logically consistent with the questions.
- **Use Case:** The engineer tests a customer support chatbot. They prepare a dataset containing customer queries and the corresponding coherent ground truth answers. By using the QnA Coherence Evaluation, they determine if the answers given by the chatbot make sense in relation to the questions posed, ensuring logical consistency and clear communication.

### QnA Fluency Evaluation

- **User Story:** As a content developer, I want to ensure that the answers produced by my QnA model are fluent and grammatically correct for a smooth user experience.
- **Use Case:** The developer optimizes a language-learning assistant. They prepare a dataset with questions and fluent, grammatically correct ground truth answers. They employ the QnA Fluency Evaluation to check that the answers provided by the assistant are fluent and grammatically accurate, enhancing the overall user experience and trust in the system.

### QnA Ada Similarity Evaluation

- **User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to evaluate the semantic similarity between my QnA model's answers and the ground truth to ensure alignment in meaning.
- **Use Case:** The engineer develops an educational QnA platform that answers students' questions. They prepare a dataset containing questions, context, and semantically accurate ground truth answers. Using the QnA Ada Similarity Evaluation, they measure the cosine similarity between the model's answers and the ground truth embedded with Ada embedding, ensuring that the responses are semantically similar to the expected answers.

### QnA GPT Similarity Evaluation

- **User Story:** As an AI developer, I want to compare the similarity of my QnA model's answers to the ground truth using a sophisticated language model to ensure high-quality responses.
- **Use Case:** The developer enhances a legal advice QnA system. They prepare a dataset with legal questions, context, and ground truth answers. By using the QnA GPT Similarity Evaluation, they assess how similar the model's answers are to the ground truth answers, using a language model to capture nuanced similarities, ensuring the system provides accurate legal advice.

### QnA F1 Score Evaluation

- **User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to compute the F1 Score of my QnA model to balance the precision and recall of the answers it provides.
- **Use Case:** The data scientist works on an academic QnA system for a digital library. They prepare a dataset with questions, context, and the corresponding ground truth answers. They use the QnA F1 Score Evaluation to measure the balance between precision and recall of the model's answers against the ground truth, ensuring that the system not only provides accurate answers but also retrieves as many correct answers as possible.
