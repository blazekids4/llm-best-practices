# LLM Chatbot RPM Fluctuation Self-Assessment Guide

This guide will help you assess the potential RPM fluctuations of your LLM chatbot based on your specific use case. Answer the questions below to evaluate the factors that could influence your chatbot's RPM.

## 1. Use Case Description

Describe your chatbot's use case:

- What is the primary purpose of the chatbot?
- Who is the target audience?
- What types of interactions are expected?

## 2. User Engagement

Estimate the level of user engagement:

- How many active users do you expect per day?
- What is the average session length (in minutes)?
- How many messages do users typically send per session?

## 3. Usage Patterns

Identify the expected usage patterns:

- Will the chatbot usage be consistent throughout the day, or will there be peak times?
  - If peak times are expected, specify the peak hours.
- Are there any anticipated events or promotions that could cause sudden spikes in usage?

## 4. Chatbot Features

Evaluate the features of your chatbot:

- List the key features of the chatbot (e.g., FAQ, customer support, transactional queries).
- Which features are likely to be used most frequently?
- What are the current limitations of your infrastructure (e.g., rate limits, maximum concurrent connections)?

## 5. Monitoring and Alerts

Determine your monitoring and alerting setup:

- Do you have monitoring tools to track RPM and other performance metrics?
- Have you set up alerts for RPM thresholds and other critical metrics?

## 6. Historical Data Analysis

Analyze historical data (if available):

- Do you have historical data on chatbot usage?
  - If yes, what are the average and peak RPM values observed?
- How does the historical usage data compare to your current expectations?

## 7. External Factors

Consider external factors that might affect RPM:

- Are there any external dependencies or integrations that could influence RPM?
- Are there any external factors (e.g., holidays, seasonality) that could impact usage?

## 8. RPM Calculation

Based on the answers above, calculate the expected RPM:

- Average RPM:
- Peak RPM:

## 9. Risk Mitigation

Plan for risk mitigation:

- What measures will you take to handle unexpected RPM spikes?
- Do you have a plan for throttling or rate limiting to prevent system overloads?
- What are your fallback mechanisms in case of high RPM scenarios?

## Conclusion

Review the completed self-assessment and use the insights gained to optimize your chatbot for expected RPM fluctuations. Ensure that your infrastructure and monitoring tools are prepared to handle both average and peak usage scenarios.
