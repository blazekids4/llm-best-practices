# Sample Scenarios - low to high RPM usage

1. **High-Traffic Customer Support Chatbots**: Large organizations, especially in sectors like telecommunications, e-commerce, and finance, deploy chatbots to handle a vast number of customer inquiries simultaneously. For example, during peak times or significant promotional events, these chatbots might handle RPMs well above 60 due to the sheer volume of concurrent user interactions.

2. **Educational Support Chatbots in Higher Education**: Research on LLM-powered chatbots in higher education settings demonstrates their ability to engage with numerous students simultaneously, particularly during enrollment periods or exam times. This high level of interaction can push RPMs beyond typical thresholds. Studies have shown the efficacy of such chatbots in providing comprehensive, real-time support, making them critical during peak usage times (Hsain & El Housni, 2024).

3. **Real-Time Data Processing and Analysis Chatbots**: In sectors requiring real-time data processing and immediate feedback, such as financial trading platforms or emergency response systems, chatbots can experience extremely high RPMs. These systems need to handle vast amounts of data and user queries simultaneously, especially during market openings or crisis situations.

4. **Re-Ranking and Search Optimization Systems**: In research contexts, where LLMs are used for re-ranking search results or optimizing query responses, the system's need to handle multiple input permutations and produce rapid, accurate outputs can lead to high RPM scenarios. These setups are particularly prevalent in search engines and large-scale information retrieval systems (Investigating Large Language Models as Re-Ranking Agents, 2024).

Implementing strategies such as rate limiting, batching, and parallel processing are critical to manage these high RPMs effectively. Utilizing advanced models like GPT-4 or specialized variants like SOLAR 10.7B can also support high-performance requirements, ensuring efficient handling of large volumes of requests (Navigating the World of Large Language Models, 2024).
